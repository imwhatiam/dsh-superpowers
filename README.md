# dsh-superpowers

Superpowers skills for DeepSeek Harness. The exact upstream version and commit are recorded in `UPSTREAM.json`. This package keeps the upstream `skills/` tree byte-for-byte raw and adds a separate DSH adapter layer:

- Registers the upstream skill catalog through `ctx.skills.registerProvider`;
- Injects the `using-superpowers` bootstrap once per top-level session through `agent/pre-step`;
- Skips delegated child sessions;
- Re-injects after compaction;
- Maps Superpowers actions to DSH tools in `adapter/dsh-tools.md`.

## Versioning

The plugin version mirrors the DeepSeek Harness release line it has been validated against. `v0.2.1` is validated on DSH `0.2.1-rc.5`. When a future DSH release is validated, bump the plugin version to that DSH base version.

## Install

> **Name note**: `dsh-superpowers` is already taken on npm. After choosing an available name (for example `dsh-superpowers-sync`), replace `<your-package-name>` below. The local development install is unaffected.

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add <your-package-name>
```

### From GitHub release

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:imwhatiam/dsh-superpowers#v0.2.1
```

### From local development directory (testing only)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile superpowers-test add /path/to/dsh-superpowers
```

Do not edit a profile's `package.json` or `cordis.patch.yml` by hand—use the `dsh plugin` CLI.

## Upstream updates

This package pins the upstream Superpowers release recorded in `UPSTREAM.json` with deterministic hash verification. To check for updates:

```bash
npm run update:check   # compare UPSTREAM.json with latest semver tag from obra/superpowers
npm run update         # clones tag, runs sync-upstream.mjs, re-runs tests
npm run verify:upstream -- --from /path/to/superpowers
npm test               # ensures compatibility
```

These update scripts are maintainer tools from the source checkout; they are not included in the published npm tarball.

If GitHub is only reachable through the local SOCKS tunnel, prefix the commands with `DSH_GIT_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080`.

After a successful update:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json`
2. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Tag and release: `git tag v0.2.2 && git push origin v0.2.2`
4. Update npm: `npm publish --access public`
5. Restart the DSH profile to reload the linked package

The repository includes `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml`: it runs weekly, checks for a new stable tag, verifies raw upstream parity, runs the full test suite, and opens a PR. It never publishes npm automatically.

## Files structure

- `skills/` — upstream Superpowers skills, byte-for-byte identical to the release in `UPSTREAM.json`
- `adapter/` — DSH-only tool mapping, path policy, and bootstrap composition
- `lib/` — DSH skill provider and bootstrap re-export
- `scripts/sync-upstream.mjs` — Raw upstream vendor script (not published)
- `scripts/update-upstream.mjs` — Automated update checker (not published)
- `scripts/verify-upstream.mjs` — Independent raw-tree parity checker (not published)
- `test/` — Unit and parity tests (not published)
- `UPSTREAM.json` — Raw upstream commit and file-hash manifest
- `cordis.patch.yml` — Bundle manifest (published)
- `LICENSE` — MIT license
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` — Attribution to Superpowers (obra)

## Quality gates

Current status (as of v0.2.1):

- ✅ **Test suite**: 14/14 tests passing
- ⚠️ **Crapper**: Known red (complexity issues in `parseBoolean`, `apply`)
- ⚠️ **Dryer**: Unsupported for JavaScript-only packages (Docker alternative available)
- ⚠️ **Mutator**: Needs more comprehensive test coverage for mutation testing

Recommendation: Publish as **preview** until quality gates are green.

## DSH specifics

- **Raw upstream**: `skills/` contains the unmodified upstream Superpowers files; DSH-only material is in `adapter/`.
- **Tool mapping**: `adapter/dsh-tools.md`; use only tools visible to the current agent and degrade when unavailable.
- **Path policy**: `adapter/path-policy.md` maps upstream `~/.superpowers` references to workspace `.superpowers/`.
- **Bootstrap source**: User-role message, injected once per session, survives replay.
- **Workspace path**: `.superpowers/` is workspace-local (add to `.gitignore`).
- **Graphviz**: Optional for `writing-skills` rendering (`dot` binary required).
- **Session storage**: Uses `$DSH_HOME/sessions/<workspace>/<id>/session.v4.jsonl.zstd`.
- **Subagents**: Bootstrap skipped in delegated children (confirmed via session logs).
